# Face-Verification-API
Face Verification API using Django and MongoDB

NOTE: To run the code, we will first have to download some libraries in the command prompt. The name of these library is saved in requirements.txt.
All the HTML files are in templates, CSS files in static. 
Once we open command prompt in our base directory, we just write 
python manage.py runserver
to run the project. We will get a link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/  to run the server.
